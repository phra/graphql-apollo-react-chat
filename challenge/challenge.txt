Hello Francesco,

It was an absolute pleasure to discuss with you earlier today. As we agreed we would like to conduct an full on technical interview with you on Wednesday (28.6.2017) at 10 am. We have scheduled two of our guys to come and give you the interview. 

On top of this we would like you to prepare for this interview.

We would like to give a task, where we would like you to:


Build a chat service (Ã  la Slack). Using your service, users should be able to:

- Choose a nickname
- Join chat rooms of their own choosing
- Send messages to other users

The service should contain both server (Node) and client (React) implementations. Use Redux/Flux/FRP for state management and libraries such as immutable.js, ramda.js to help you with busy work.

What I value here is idiomatic code, quality, and end-to-end implementation. Not the amount of features you can cram in, so make it short and sweet! Remember not to use too much time on this.

In case you have any questions feel free to send us an email.


I hope your hands are healing well from the scooter accident!

Best regards,

Iiro Pikkarainen, Reaktor B.V.
